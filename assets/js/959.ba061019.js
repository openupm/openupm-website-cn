Handles meta files as well.Moving assets to unversioned folder will ask the user to add that folder to SVN as well.Moving folders / files that have conflicts will be rejected.Will work with other tools as long as they move assets using Unity API.Provides assets context menu for manual SVN operations like commit, update, revert etc.Prerequisites: - SVN CLI (Command Line Interface) needs to be installed (TortoiseSVN has it available). - Menu items work with TortoiseSVN (for Windows) and SnailSVN (for MacOS) clients.Usage: "Assets/SVN/...".WARNING: Never focus Unity while the project updating in the background. Newly added asset guids may get corrupted in which case the Library folder needs to be deleted.Preferred workflow is to always work inside Unity - use the "Assets/SVN/..." menus. "Assets/SVN/Update All" will block Unity while updating, to avoid Unity processing assets at the same time.')])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);s.default=n.exports}}]);
